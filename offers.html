								<div class="item_text"><p>When thinking about climate paradoxes, Scandinavia, regarded as one of the coldest regions of the planet, is definitely a place that comes to mind. To live in a cold place like that, is not an easy job for Brazilians to accomplish. Perhaps due to our cultural differences, we do not even consider this region as a travelling option for a honeymoon or a backpacking trip. Big mistake!!! Its singular beauty comes from a different sort of nature which we are not used to, and that is exactly why it overcomes our expectations. Unless there is the desire to have a glacial experience, it is worthwhile to consider the possibility of visiting northern Europe when Summer takes place,during the months of July and September. Scandinavia is officially formed by three countries: Denmark, Norway and Sweden. In a more general view, we can also include Finland in the so-called Fino- Scandinavia. A trip to this Nordic region should definitely include the capital cities of these three countries: Copenhagen, Oslo and Stockholm.</p>
